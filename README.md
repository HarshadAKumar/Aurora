# Aurora
Aurora is trying to create a website that will instruct individuals on how to approach kids if they notice any behavioral abnormalities and how to react to them from the ground up as well as spread awareness of the problem. In addition, we want to work with the NGOâ€™s to make these events more productive and effective.
