        <p class="au">Our team at Aurora is trying to create a website that will instruct individuals on how<br>
            to approach kids if they notice any behavioral abnormalities and how to react to<br>
            them from the ground up as well as spread awareness of the problem.<br><br><br>
            We also want to work with the NGOâ€™s to make these events more productive<br> and effective.<br><br><br>
            We also want to build a live chatroom and 24/7 helpline for the convenience<br> of the public.<br><br><br>
            For further enhancement we would like to collaborate with the government<br> on strictening the
            laws against these heinous behavior. </p>

            <p class="p"> Since the majority of crimes are committed by the victim's acquaintance,<br>
                it can be inferred from the provided image that either the victim is afraid<br>
                to disclose this to any adults or the child is unconscious of what is happening.<br>
                as in what is a good touch and what is a bad one.<br>
                Despite the fact that information is already readily available online,<br>
                Adults are not always aware of a child's behavioural changes when they<br>
                have been abused. With the use of videos, we hope to educate them.</p>

    <p>We think that the government is ignorant of the posttraumatic stress disorder that a child experiences <br>
        following any kind of sexual abuse. According to Article 75, the offender may receive a maximum sentence<br>
        of 10 years in prison and must pay a fine of 5 lakhs, yet these punishments pale in comparison to the mental<br>
        pain that the child is experiencing because they are actually fighting just to survive while the brains of <br>
        other children are being nurtured and living their childhood normally. As a result, the government should <br>
        tighten the regulations to the point where the individual has to think atleast twice before carrying out such<br>
        heinous acts. For instance, the government took 7 years 3 months and 4 days to give the final verdict on the<br>
        Nirbhaya case which is not at all fair on her part.<br></p>
